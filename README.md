**(Named after the hound, not the bird or plane.)**

Jinja2 & sass/scss aware site builder builder

## What?

Assert generator in the same vane as webpack/gulp & browsify but tailored to sass/scss and Jinja2.
Javascript support via integration with webpack. Harrier also supports arbitrary build steps via 
composable "tools".

## Why?

Well partly because I couldn't find a tools to do what I wanted.

Partly because I'm much happier with everything that doesn't have to be javascript not being python.

## Install

(once it's released)

    pip install harrier

## Usage

    harrier --help
